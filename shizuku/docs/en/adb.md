### 4.1. How to avoid Shizuku stop (even if there is no restart)

**Please follow the rules below, otherwise it will be invalid.**

1. Do not turn off "USB Debugging"
2. Do not modify the USB usage mode after connecting the device to the computer (or change to "charge only" if not)

   After a security patch, if the USB usage mode is not "charge only", changing the USB usage mode will kill all processes of adb. **Therefore, be sure not to modify the USB usage mode after change to "charge only".** (This step may not be needed if your device has not received security patchs for a long time)

   In addition, some manufacturers (such as Sony) added a dialog that will modify the USB usage mode when the computer is connected. Please don't click any dialog before disconnecting.

Turn on "Allow ADB Debugging Options in 'Charge Only' mode" in "Developer Options".
